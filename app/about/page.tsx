          I am a QA Lead and Automation Architect with over 10 years of experience
          in delivering high-quality software across fintech, e-commerce, and
          large-scale distributed systems. My career evolved from manual testing
          into building enterprise-grade automation frameworks and leading QA
          teams.
          <br /><br />
          I focus on shift-left testing, automation-first strategies, and aligning
          quality engineering with business outcomes.
