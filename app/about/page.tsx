        I am a QA Lead and Automation Architect with nearly a decade of experience in manual and automated testing across mobile, web, and backend systems. I have worked extensively in fast-paced Agile environments, partnering closely with engineering, DevOps, and product teams to deliver reliable, scalable software.

My expertise spans test strategy, automation framework design, performance testing, and large-scale migration projects. I have led critical initiatives such as the migration of Paytm Movies to Zomato District, ensuring seamless user transitions, data integrity, and platform stability.

I am passionate about automation-first quality engineering, shift-left testing, and continuous improvement. Over the years, I have helped teams reduce manual effort by up to 40% through effective automation, while maintaining strong ownership of quality across the SDLC.
          <br /><br />
          I focus on shift-left testing, automation-first strategies, and aligning
          quality engineering with business outcomes.
